				<p>A plagiarist's worst nightmare.</p>
	</div>
				<p>Qolassus scans the web for other people using your Quora content.  Whether you're quoted with attribution
					in the New York Times or some hack blogger is just jacking your stuff - Qolassus will scour the web for all
				your answers and provide a full report.</p>
				<p>To get your Qolassus report, 
					</p><ol style="line-height: 3;">
  <li>  Download your full archive of answers using <a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/quark/'>quArk</a>. (Firefox only.)</li>
  <li>  Email the Quora_Archive file to me, christopher.j.reiss@gmail.com</li>
  <li>  <a href='https://paypal.me/creiss/20'>Pay me $20</a> (or something).  I'll reply and let you know when I'll be emailing your Qolassus report (probably a day or two.)</li>
                   </ol>
				<p></p>
				<p><b>Why a fee?</b> I originally planned to make Qolassus a free plugin like Quark.   That turned out to be impossible.
					Search engines don't like to be hammered with thousands of search requests in a row.   So I had to implement certain,
					um, work-arounds.   These workarounds require a rather exotic environment (access to a hundred or so proxy servers), 
					and some personal attention while they churn.   This is also the reason that I can only process a few of these per day.
				</p>
				<p>
					That said, I don't want to deny anyone who can't afford it.   If $20 is too steep, $10 or $5 is fine too.  And if you 
can't spare a dime, just let me know and I'll be happy to provide it for free.

<p>Personally, when I ran this thing on my own content (about 3,000 answers), I was fairly startled as I scrolled 
				   through over a hundred incidents of my stuff ending up in strange locations.   
				   </p><p>A good many were legit : Media outlets like Business Insider - and smaller publishers - giving full credit.   Or random websites that also did the right thing and attributed the text.</p>
				   <p>But most of it was just plagiarism.  And man, quite a vigorous assortment !  Here's a sample of what Qollasus turned up :</p>
				   <p>
					   </p><ul>
						   <li>I ended up on some dude's motivational poster in Pakistan.</li>
						   <li>I made it into a motor scooter manual!  (Kind of proud of that one.)</li>
                           <li>Some chick on a professional forum just pasted an answer of mine in a discussion thread.   Other people applauded her writing style.  I took a smug, secret bow.</li>
                           <li>I ended up in lots of places I would never have though to look.   Pinterest.  Tumbler.  That sort of thing </li>
					   </ul>
				   <p></p>
				   <p>
					   I can't say I'm mad about it all.   Mostly flattered, I guess.  
				   </p>
				   <p>
					   Will I do anything about it?   Nah.   Well - I may log into that professional forum, email me if you can think of something really funny to say!
