## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/iridiumblue/iridiumblue.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/iridiumblue/iridiumblue.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

**Languages:**  C++, Python, LISP, JavaScript/JQuery(Mobile), and others.

**Special skills:** Writing and mathematics.   For some reason a lot of people follow me on Quora  - https://www.quora.com/profile/Christopher-Reiss

 

**Recent:**

Engaged full-time in Deep Learning Research, the details of which I’m rather secretive about until I get to know you.   I spend my days steeped in PyTorch and tensors and making wild claims about innovations in Neural Nets.

 

**Mar 2013 – Jan 2017:** 

Independent consultant specializing in Mobile App development, data visualization, and business applications of Social Media.    Special emphasis on cross-platform applications in HTML5 which run on iPhone, Android, and desktop web browsers simultaneously.

 

**Oct 2011 – Feb 2013:**

**Principal Engineer for Accenture**, Boston MA (and Denver, CO). (Accenture acquired a group of Nokia employees as part of Nokia's transition to Microsoft's platform.)


Developed mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and cross-platform in HTML5.    Designed best practices for mobile development for a team of thirty developers.

Contributed to Time Warner Cable's online video streaming service. Led development on a usage tracker in JQuery which harvested all user interactions and video playback to provide TWC with metrics to improve the quality of their service. This was a big integration project using Backbone, Grails, TWC's software and Accenture's “big data” harvester. 

**Oct 2008 – Oct 2011:**

**Senior software developer for Nokia**, Burlington, MA.

Contributed priority-1 bug fixes to WebKit (the rendering engine beneath Chrome and Safari.) Patches “landed” and are now present in both browsers. Work done in C++ on Linux.

Developed features and fixes for Nokia's “Web Runtime Library” - Nokia's early implementation of Web Apps. Done in C++, Qt and WebKit on Linux.

**Nov 2007 – June 2008:**

Cofounder and Chief Technology Officer, Celltak, Natick, MA.

Invented and deployed technology which enables two people to swap contact information by holding their cell phones close together. Wrote patent application, successfully recruited management team and initial investors. Sole engineer to design and deploy.

Technologies (All Open Source) : Python, FreeSwitch, Linux (Ubuntu). Web site written in PySP (A python analog to ASP) and MySql. The acoustic technology involved a good deal of experimentation and mathematics, especially Fast Fourier Transforms.

**Jan 2004 – Nov 2007:**

Independent Consultant to a variety of small companies. Design and Programming, worked with company principals to guide new product development, programming in C++, Python and VB.Net both alone and in concert with team members. Projects included :

Conceived and developed VisionFlux, an application which highlights changes in a visual field. (For example, if someone moved your coffee cup, this app would show the moved cup. Written primarily for surveillance applications.) Written in C++ and Python for linux, involved special-purpose algorithms to distinguish important visual differences from noise.

Devised and wrote a 'preference-crawler', which crawls music collections in a peer-to-peer file share. Similar to Amazon's “also likes” feature, this app generated a 'preference browser' where, from any given song, the user can browse other songs which most frequently co-occur in people's collections. Written in Python for Unix.

 

**Jan 2002 - Jun 2003:**

**Chief Software Architect**, Digital Self Corp, Cambridge, MA.

Designed new features, acted as Lead Developer for Expertise Location Software in .NET and C++. This was a very dynamic group composed of MIT and Harvard students, funded by professors of the Harvard Business School. The software was essentially a search engine for expertise found in people. It used a variety of AI/linguistic techniques : taxonomies, semantic nets, bayesian nets, in-house algorithms.

 

**Mar 1997 - Dec 2001:**

Senior Developer, ServiceSoft/Kana/Broadbase (acquisitions), Natick, MA.
Company was among the first to deploy AI techniques to Web-based Product troubleshooting, clients included Intel and Eddie Bauer.

Wrote and maintained object-oriented "knowledge engine", the product's core component. This component applied a mix of AI techniques to guide an end-user through a Q&A session for customer support. Speed, elegance, and extensibility were critical to the success of the product. This component was developed in MSVC++ using COM/ActiveX.

**May 1989 - Dec 1996**

**Software Developer**, Shearwater (a contractor for the Naval Undersea Warfare Center)

Designed and wrote a programming language which encoded war-gaming tactics in a submarine warfare simulation. The syntax for the language was entirely data-driven, allowing it to expand and change in the face of ever-changing requirements from analysts. This project garnered considerable attention (and funding), and was used to drive a new global warfare simulator (nobody got hurt.) Project was developed in C++ on a Unix platform, also ported to Windows.

Wrote a variety of data analysis tools in C and X-windows, including a 3-D rendering 'widget'. Acted as mathematical 'guru'.

Educational: BS Mathematics, Rochester Inst. Technology, Roch., NY 1990.

**Held US Secret security clearance, 1991-1996**

 
**Academic Awards:**

Putnam Mathematics Competition: 254th highest score in North America.

Kearse Student Writing Award, given to the best undergraduate paper in any undergraduate class.
