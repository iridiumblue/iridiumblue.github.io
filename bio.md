Chris Reiss hails from Norwich, Connecticut.   He took an early interest in computers, before the Apple II and its cousins burst onto the scene in the early 80's.   He wrote his first software on the VAX mainframes at Connecticut College (where his father taught.)   Mostly these were games or programs to solve math problems.   As a student, Chris was hired by his High School (Norwich Free Academy) to write software that processed grades and payroll.

 

Chris attended Rochester Institute of Technology on a scholarship, graduating in Applied Mathematics in 1989.   While there, he was ranked #254 in North America on the Putnam Competition in mathematics.   He also won a campus-wide writing award for a philosophy paper on Godelâ€™s Theorem.

 

His first job out of school was writing war-game simulation software for the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, an R&D branch of the US Navy reporting directly to the Pentagon in support of the nuclear ballistic submarine fleet .   Here, he learned OOP, C++, the power of visualization and the importance of keeping up with new technology.  

 

As the Cold War ended and the dot com boom stirred, Chris moved to the Boston where he has lived ever since.   He has worked for a variety of startups, in varying roles as an employee, consultant, and cofounder.   In 2007 he came up with a way for cell phones to exchange contact information acoustically, and secured funding for a startup to pursue this idea :  http://www.faqs.org/patents/app/20090156202    He's also worked for a couple of very large companies : Nokia and Accenture.

 

Chris loves new technology and understands that the less code you write, the fewer problems you have.   He is a generalist with serious coding chops : He has contributed code to Webkit (the rendering engine beneath Chrome and Safari.)

 

He still loves to write on a variety of topics - technical and non-technical.   He was named a Quora Top Writer multiple times.
